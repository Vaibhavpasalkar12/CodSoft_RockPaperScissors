# CodSoft_RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game that is widely popular and often used as a decision-making tool or simply for entertainment. The game is typically played between two people, although variations exist for larger groups. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: a fist representing "rock," an open hand representing "paper," or a V-shaped hand representing "scissors." The winner is determined based on a simple set of rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie and usually played again. Rock Paper Scissors is not only a fun game to play but also serves as an interesting subject for coding projects, allowing developers to practice logic, decision-making, and user interaction in programming languages like Python.
